# Component Library

Hello there, this is meant to grow into a fully fledged ui element library with all the standard components like toggles, comboboxes, etc.

## Design Guidelines

### Core Principles

- Components should be available in multiple styles / colors, but still work the same
- I wanna learn design from this.

### Styles

- shadow (like material design)
- flat
  - with lines / without lines?
- non-flat?
- light/dark

### Typography

TODO

### Spacing / Grid

TODO

### Element sizing

- "small elements" == line height?
- TODO

## Components

## TODO

- Come up with design guidelines
